This repository contains code in HTML and CSS for a simple personal, resume website. All of the HTML code is contained in the index.html file. To style the HTML code bootstrap.css, main.css and font-awesome.min.css were all used, and they can be found in the css directory. Bootstrap version 3.0 was used for the main css styling, and the customizing styling rules are in the main.css file. Lastly, the icons used are styled in the font-awesome.min.css file.

This simple HTML website was my first attempt at learning HTML and styling it with CSS. To complete this website I followed https://codetheweb.blog/2017/12/10/steps-to-creating-a-website/ tutorial. I quickly learned what HTML tags are, how they can be used, how everything can be styled with CSS and how to make the most of Boostrap.
